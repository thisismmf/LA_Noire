Chapter 1
Introduction


1.2 Evaluation Criteria
Each checkpoint and the final submission will be evaluated based on:

   1.​ Meeting the requirements specified in the project document.
   2.​ Clean and maintainable code, following principles of SE.
Note:

   ●​ A minimum of 15 commits per checkpoint is required to receive the grade for that
      checkpoint.
   ●​ The repository (or repositories) must be public and accessible.


1.3 Checkpoints

1.3.1 First Checkpoint
Only the back-end will be evaluated.


Each required endpoint must include:

   ●​   Proper error handling
   ●​   Proper access level management
   ●​   Adherence to REST principles
   ●​   Compliance with software engineering best practices


1.3.2 Second Checkpoint
The front-end, connected to the back-end, will be evaluated.


Important notes:

   ●​ You may need to modify the back-end due to:
         ●​ Incorrect requirement analysis
         ●​ New front-end development requirements
         ●​ Major architectural changes
   ●​ Such modifications are allowed and encouraged.


1.5 Project Implementation Guide

First Checkpoint Guidance
Start with entity model design.


The entire system infrastructure is built on these models and their relationships. Any

weakness or oversimplification here will create major problems in complex workflows

such as:

   ●​   Case creation
   ●​   Evidence registration
   ●​   Case resolution
   ●​   Role management
Models must be:

   ●​ Precise
   ●​ Aligned with documented requirements
   ●​ Maintainable
Endpoints must be built based on proper model design, not the other way around.


You must:

   ●​   Follow REST principles
   ●​   Manage access levels properly
   ●​   Implement proper error handling
   ●​   Provide complete Swagger documentation
The back-end must be:

   ●​   Clear
   ●​   Clean
   ●​   Testable
   ●​   Ready to connect to the front-end
Second Checkpoint Guidance
Your focus should be on:

   ●​ Accurate
   ●​ Efficient
   ●​ Modular UI implementation
All pages must be:

   ●​   Role-based
   ●​   Responsive
   ●​   UX/UI compliant
   ●​   Logically structured
Complex flows such as:

   ●​   Detective board
   ●​   Case status
   ●​   Most-wanted page
   ●​   Admin panel
must function without placing unnecessary load on the back-end.


This phase requires:

   ●​   Proper state management
   ●​   Loading indicators
   ●​   Front-end testing
   ●​   Full Dockerization
   ●​   Engineering best practices in component structure
The front-end is considered acceptable when it can present project scenarios smoothly

and clearly without requiring major back-end modifications.



Chapter 2
General Project Description

2.1 Initial Explanation
You have likely heard of the game L.A. Noire by Rockstar.​

In this game, you play as a detective solving criminal cases in Los Angeles.


Since the story takes place in the 1940s, almost all police department operations are

conducted manually and documented on paper.


Now, in 2025, the city police department has decided to:

   ●​ Automate operations
   ●​ Store data digitally
The requirements of this department are described in this document.​

You are responsible for building a web-based system that fulfills these requirements.


The document will also discuss:

   ●​ System workflows
   ●​ Access levels involved in those workflows


2.2 User Roles
Base user roles are divided into the following categories:

   ●​   System Administrator
   ●​   Chief of Police
   ●​   Captain
   ●​   Sergeant
   ●​   Detective
   ●​   Police Officer and Patrol Officer
   ●​   Cadet
   ●​   Complainant and Witness
   ●​   Suspect and Criminal
   ●​   Judge
   ●​   Coroner
   ●​   Base User
Important:


The system administrator must be able to:
   ●​ Add new roles
   ●​ Remove existing roles
   ●​ Modify roles
All without changing the source code.



2.3 Project Technology Stack
The required stack for this project:

   ●​ Front-end: React or NextJS
   ●​ Back-end: Django REST Framework
   ●​ Database (recommended): PostgreSQL




Chapter 3
Project Details

3.1 Police Ranks

3.1.1 Cadet
The cadet is the lowest-ranking employee of the police department.​

The primary responsibility of the cadet is to filter and perform initial validation of

received complaints and, if there are no issues, forward them to higher ranks for case

formation.



3.1.2 Coroner
The coroner is responsible for examining and approving or rejecting biological and

medical evidence.



3.1.3 Police Officer and Patrol Officer
Police officers and patrol officers are responsible for conducting field activities and

reporting any suspicious phenomena or crimes they encounter for the purpose of case

formation.



3.1.4 Detective
The main responsibility of the detective is to search for evidence and reason about the

connections between them.


After analyzing the case, the detective identifies the crime suspects and reports them to

the sergeant.


The detective also assists the sergeant during the interrogation process and in drawing

conclusions from it.



3.1.5 Sergeant
The sergeant is the detective’s primary collaborator and supervisor in solving the case.


The sergeant issues arrest and interrogation orders for suspects.


The sergeant determines the probability of guilt for suspects and reports the result to

the captain or the chief of police.



3.1.6 Captain
The captain is responsible for approving the case and referring it to the judiciary for trial.
3.1.7 Chief of Police
In critical crimes, the chief of police, instead of the captain, refers suspects to the

judiciary for trial.



3.2 Crime Levels

3.2.1 Level 3
Minor crimes such as petty theft and small-scale fraud fall into this category.



3.2.2 Level 2
More serious crimes such as automobile theft fall into this category.



3.2.3 Level 1
Major crimes such as murder fall into this category.



3.2.4 Critical Level
Severe crimes such as serial murder or assassination of an important individual fall into

this category.




Chapter 4
Workflows

4.1 Registration and Login
Each user must first create an account in the system with the role of a base user by

providing at least:
   ●​   Username
   ●​   Password
   ●​   Email
   ●​   Phone number
   ●​   First name and last name
   ●​   National ID number
After that, the system administrator assigns the required role(s) to each user.


Roles are dynamic, and:

   ●​ New roles can be created
   ●​ Existing roles can be deleted
Login to the system must be performed using a password and one of the following:

   ●​   Username
   ●​   National ID
   ●​   Phone number
   ●​   Email
It is obvious that all of these fields must be unique.



4.2 Case Formation
A case begins to take shape when either:

   ●​ A complainant files a complaint, or
   ●​ A police rank (other than a cadet) observes a crime scene or receives a report
      and wants to register it.


4.2.1 Case Formation Through Complaint Registration
First, the complainant logs into the system.​

Then, through the website menus, they request the creation of a case.


They enter the case information and perform an initial submission.


Next, the information is sent to a cadet for review.
If the cadet confirms that all submitted information is valid, the cadet must forward the

case to their superior (a police officer).


If, after the police officer’s review, everything is correct, the case is officially formed.


Pay attention to the following:

   ●​ If the cadet finds a defect in the case, it is returned to the complainant for
      correction.
   ●​ When the cadet sends the case back to the complainant, it must include an error
      message written by the cadet.
   ●​ If the police officer finds a defect in the case, it is not returned directly to the
      complainant. Instead, it is sent back to the cadet for re-evaluation.
   ●​ If the complainant submits incomplete or incorrect information three times, the
      case is invalidated and will no longer be reviewed by police ranks.
   ●​ A case may have multiple complainants. The information of complainants must
      be approved or rejected by the cadet.


4.2.2 Case Formation Through Crime Scene Registration
First, a police rank other than a cadet observes a crime scene or receives a report from

local witnesses.


In this type of case:

   ●​ The police officer records the crime scene along with the date and time in the
      case.
   ●​ The phone number and national ID of witnesses are recorded for future
      follow-up.
   ●​ In this case, only one superior rank must approve the case (if the chief of police
      registers it, no approval is required).
   ●​ Initially, these cases do not have complainants, but over time, complainants may
      be added.


4.3 Evidence Registration
Evidence is divided into two categories, which will be discussed below.
Important notes:

    ●​ All evidence must include a title and description.
    ●​ All evidence must have a registration date.
    ●​ All evidence must have a registrant.


4.3.1 Witness Statements or Local Testimonies
For each case, a transcription of witness statements may be recorded.


Additionally, local individuals may have:

    ●​ Images
    ●​ Videos
    ●​ Audio
related to the incident.



4.3.2 Discovered Evidence: Biological and Medical
At the crime scene, evidence may be found that requires forensic examination.


For example:

    ●​ Blood stains
    ●​ Hair strands
    ●​ Fingerprints
These must be examined and approved either by the coroner or through the national

identity database.


These items must be stored with:

    ●​ A title
    ●​ A description
    ●​ One or more images
The result of follow-up from the coroner or database is initially empty but may later be

filled.
4.3.3 Discovered Evidence: Vehicles
A vehicle related to the crime scene may be found in the area.


The following must be recorded as evidence:

   ●​ Model
   ●​ License plate
   ●​ Color
If the vehicle does not have a license plate, its serial number must be recorded.


Note:


When saving this type of evidence, license plate and serial number cannot both have

values at the same time.



4.3.4 Discovered Evidence: Identification Documents
An identification document belonging to a suspect may be found at the crime scene.


In this case, the system must allow storing:

   ●​ The full name of the document owner
   ●​ Other document information in key–value format
These key–value pairs do not have a fixed number and may even not exist at all.


For example, it could be an identification card that only contains the person’s name.



4.3.5 Discovered Evidence: Other Items
Other types of evidence must be recorded as a simple title–description record.



4.4 Case Resolution
After formation, a case may be reviewed by a detective.
The detective has a detective board where documents and evidence are placed (in any

location chosen by the detective).


The detective may connect related documents with a red line.


After analysis, the detective reports the primary suspects to the sergeant and waits for

approval.


The sergeant reviews the available evidence and matches the detective’s reasoning

with the suspects’ records.

   ●​ If approved, a confirmation message is sent to the detective and the arrest
      process begins.
   ●​ If the sergeant disagrees, the objection is returned to the detective in the form of
      a message and the case remains open.
Note:


New documents and evidence may be added during case resolution.​

For each addition, a notification must be sent to the detective.



4.5 Suspect Identification and Interrogation
After arrest, suspects are interrogated by both the sergeant and the detective.


Each of them assigns a guilt probability score from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).


These scores are sent to the captain.


The captain gives the final opinion based on:

   ●​ Statements
   ●​ Evidence
   ●​ Recorded scores
In critical-level crimes, after the captain’s decision, the chief of police must also approve

or reject the captain’s decision.
4.6 Trial
The guilty individual must go to court.


The judge must have access to:

   ●​   The entire case
   ●​   All evidence and documents
   ●​   Full details of all police members involved in the case
   ●​   All mentioned entities with complete specifications
   ●​   Every report
   ●​   All approvals or rejections and their details
The judge then records the final verdict of guilty or not guilty.


If guilty, the judge records the punishment with a title and description.



4.7 Suspect Status
From the moment a person is identified as a suspect in a case, they are placed under

the status of wanted.


Suspects who have been wanted for more than one month are placed under most

wanted status.


Their photo and details must be displayed on a page visible to all users.


Note 1: Ranking Formula for the Most Wanted Page
Ranking is calculated as:


max(Lj) × max(Di)


Where:

   ●​ max(Lj) = The maximum number of days the person has been wanted in an open
      case
   ●​ max(Di) = The highest crime level committed so far (1 to 4 corresponding to
      Level 3 to Critical), considering both open and closed cases


Below each person’s information, a reward must be displayed for providing information

about them.


The reward is calculated as:


max(Lj) × max(Di) × 20,000,000


The amount is in Rials.



4.8 Reward
A base user logs into the system and submits information regarding a case or suspect.


A police officer performs an initial review.

   ●​ If the information is completely invalid, it is rejected.
   ●​ Otherwise, it is forwarded to the detective responsible for the case.
If the detective confirms the information:

   ●​ The user is notified that their information was useful.
   ●​ A unique identifier is issued to the user.
The user can then go to the police department and present the code to receive their

reward.


Additionally, all police ranks must be able to:

   ●​ Enter the person’s national ID
   ●​ Enter the unique code
and view:

   ●​ The reward amount
   ●​ The relevant user’s information
4.9 Bail and Fine Payment (Optional)
Suspects of Level 2 and Level 3 crimes may be released from detention by paying bail.


Level 3 criminals (with sergeant approval) may also be released by paying a fine.


The amount is determined by the sergeant.


Therefore, your system must be connected to a payment gateway.
